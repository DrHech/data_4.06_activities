# 4.06 Activity 4

So far we have seen quite a lot of distributions, but is there one to rule them all? [This](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html) is a simulator for some distributions, try to play with it as much as you can and think about the results you are getting.
**Hint**: Try to customize your distributions and extract some means from it.
